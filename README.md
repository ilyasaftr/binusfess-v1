# BINUS-FESS V1
BINUS FESS v1 is a Twitter bot designed for BINUS University students, allowing them to send anonymous confessions or "menfess" on Twitter. The project is built using Node.js and MySQL as the tech stack. It also utilizes the NodeNsfwJSAPI library (https://github.com/ilyasaftr/NodeNsfwJSAPI) to enable NSFW detection on images.

Please note that this project was developed when I was first learning Node.js, so there may be some unclear or poorly written code. This code represents the v1 version of BINUS FESS, while the bot currently operates on the v2 version.

Contributions to BINUS FESS v1 are currently not accepted as this version is no longer actively maintained. However, you are welcome to fork the repository and create your own version based on this code.
